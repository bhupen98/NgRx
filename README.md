### Key Concepts
* _Actions describe unique events that are dispatched from components and services._
* _State changes are handled by pure functions called reducers that take the current state and the latest action to compute a new state._
* _Selectors are pure functions used to select, derive and compose pieces of state._
* _State accessed with the Store, an observable of state and an observer of actions._
